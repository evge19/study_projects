Radius is the distance between the center and the farthest point of any class.
Each feature has to be weighted.
Vectors of features and weights have the same dimensionality.
We do not need to initialize weights as zeros, because there are no restrictions in further calculations.
After this step the weights can be updated.
The bigger margin easier for PLA to separate the classes.
